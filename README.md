# Journey of Learning Kafka
This repo contains my journey of learning Kafka from Zero using Java as the programming language. Please see the course list below as my learning references.

## Prerequisites
1. Install Java 11 from [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html)
2. Provision Local or Cloud Kafka Cluster. Follow [this step](https://www.conduktor.io/get-started/) to setup local clutser which utilizes Dockerized Redpanda as the Kafka replacement. 
But if you decide to use the SAAS one, you might want to check:
